Freezeframe
===========

Play and pause animated GIFs by hovering over or clicking on them.

By default, animated GIFs will start playing automatically and the loop forever.
If you have a lot of them on a page, it can become quite distracting. This
module uses the third-party [freezeframe.js](http://ctrl-freaks.github.io/freezeframe.js)
script to let you control how animated GIFs are displayed on your site.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules
